# Missing party or raid buffs

This WeakAura tracks buffs on party or raid members (which buffs are tracked is configured through aura options) by showing buff icons and numbers of members without the buff. This information can be printed to **/party** or **/raid** channels (depends on whether you are in party or raid).

It can be helpful to people who is responsible for keeping the group buffed, and, for the leaders who want to see who misses the buffs, and have an instrument to share this information with responsible group members.
